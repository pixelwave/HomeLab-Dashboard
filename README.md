# HomeLab-Dashboard
A custom dashboard for Home Assistant

I wanted to share my - work in progress - endeavour to replace heimdall with a custom Homeassistant page.

Some noteworthy plugins for people trying to rebuild:

* Multiple-Entity-Row (HACS)
* Monitor Docker (HACS)

I can control hardware (on/off) and read power consumption via my Gude PDU / POE access to the Unifi Switch.

I uploaded two sample .yaml files. One for the Homelab page and one for the Power/PDU page.

Also all the custom icons I created so far.
